# Audio To YT Album
## Description
This script will take a folder of audio files and create a video for each file. The video will be a static image with the audio file playing in the background. The script will then upload the videos to YouTube and create a playlist for the videos.

It definitely is not refined, but it gets the job done.

When exporting, the GUI completely freezes.
